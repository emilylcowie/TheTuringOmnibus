" Describe finite automata that accepts languages:
    a. (ab)*(a+b)*
    b. 0 + 1
    c. 0* + 1 (a finite automation may have more than one accepting state) "



a.  (ab)* means that zero or more "ab" pairs will be accepted in the language.
    (a+b)* means that after the "ab" pairs, zero or more "a"s or "b"s will be accepted.
    So will it accept any combination of a and b??
    If so, is this not the same as just (a+b)*??


b.  This accepts strings that are either 0 or 1.
    Not accepted:
        "00" 
        1. Read '0', move to q1
        2. Read '0', no transition defined from q1 = Not accepted

    
c.  0* means that zero or more 0s will be accepted.
    1 means that the prior must end with a single 1 to be accepted.
    Accepted:
        "001"
        1. Start at q0
        2. Read 0 and stay in q0
        3. Read 0 and stay in q0
        4. Read 1 and move to q2 (accepting state) = Accepted
        (Others include "1", "0", "", "0000000001", "000000")
    Not Accepted:
        "011"
        1. Start at q0
        2. Read 0 and stay in q0
        3. Read 1 and move to q2
        4. Read 1 - no transition defined going from q2 = Not Accepted
        (Others include "10", "0101", "010", "100")
